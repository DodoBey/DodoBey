### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**This is Dogukan (aka Dodo) and I am a Front-End Developer from Victoria, BC with an entrepreneurial and engineering background.**

- I'm currently working on V2 of my webpage, My Personal Trainer, Balanced Habits, and the simple app to control my lights in my home office/personal room setup. To check them out;
 - **My Personal Trainer** - It is a full stack Nextjs App utilized with OpenAI API and it lets users create a workout plan by entering some information. [Repository](https://github.com/DodoBey/mypersonaltrainer) [URL to APP](https://mypersonaltrainer.onrender.com/)
 - **Balanced Habits** - It is a full stack MERN habit tracker app, the idea came from my Dietitian wife and simply trying to stay on the green side. [Repository](https://github.com/DodoBey/balancedHabits) [URL to APP](https://balanced-habits.onrender.com/)
 - Lights app to control Govee lights from the computer [Repository](https://github.com/DodoBey/goveeLightsControl)
- I'm also learning **ThreeJS** which I really enjoy with it. And soon, I'll be starting to develop a basic game with it.
- I also have a [Developer/Personal/Professional Blog]([https://dogukanyigiter.notion.site/dogukanyigiter/](https://dogukanyigiter.notion.site/05609345f1804398883a4b863723aa37?v=3fcd8ee2c52d4ee7bd7688aa39f3fd45), I know it sounds complicated but I am using my blog as a reminder, notepad, and vault to keep the important things safe ðŸ™‚ You should check it out!
